# Vue 3 + Vite + OpenAI API Project

## Project Description

This project is a simple Vue 3 application built with Vite that utilizes the OpenAI API. It's designed as a learning tool to practice making requests to the OpenAI API and handling the responses. The application features a basic UI where users can input text and receive responses generated by OpenAI.

## Features

- Vue 3 for reactive components.
- Vite for fast development and builds.
- Integration with the OpenAI API.
- Basic UI for interaction.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn


Usage
The application presents a simple form where you can enter text.
